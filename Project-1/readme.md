# Brief Summary :

## Task :

1. Implement the given optimization algorithm and write a research paper in your own words. Take any suitable problem and try to solve using given optimization algorithm. Here I have attached one research paper for your reference.
2. Optimization Algorithm Assigned : Chaotic CSA(Crow Search Algorithm)

## How I implemented it in short :

1) I wrote an objective function (30x-x^2) 
2) I then initialized the algorithm parameters needed for algo ((M) number of crows,(Y) initial position of crows,(N) memory of  what they think where the food is hidden, AP , fl,tMax (Max iteation allowed)) 
3) Then wrote the iterative algorithmic part
4) Finally plotted  (N(memory) v/s T(iteration)) for each crow.
5) They were converging to value : 15 (our optimal point for constrained univariate optimization algorithm)
